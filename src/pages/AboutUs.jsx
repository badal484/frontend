        SmartRent is a student-driven project designed to help people find
        affordable rooms and PGs quickly. Many students overpay without knowing
        cheaper options nearby—our mission is to fix that.

        Built using React, Django, and smart filtering systems, SmartRent aims
        to provide a transparent and efficient accommodation platform.
